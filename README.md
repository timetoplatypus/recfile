# Recutils

A Go library to access the human-editable, plain text databases called GNU recfiles

# Features

While comments are a first-class citizen in the GNU recfiles specification, this rudimentary library does not respect that. In all other regards, however, I hope this implementation is correct

# Examples

For now, the tests are actually simple enough that they should serve as good examples of how to use the core library functions (i.e. `Load()`, `Save()`). Please see `database_test.go` :-)
